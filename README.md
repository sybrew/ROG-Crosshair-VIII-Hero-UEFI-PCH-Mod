# UEFI PCH Mod for ROG Crosshair VIII Hero

This is a modded version of ROG Crosshair VIII Hero's UEFI to eliminate the unnecessary PCH fan noise with a better fan curve.
This also unlocks the Q-FAN controls for PCH.

Download the C8H.CAP to a USB drive and update your BIOS.
As with any BIOS update, all your BIOS settings will be reset to default.
